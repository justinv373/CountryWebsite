                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Salvadoran cuisine is a vibrant mix of indigenous and Spanish influences, characterized by the heavy use of corn, beans, rice, and a variety of meats and seafood. Key dishes include the national food, pupusas, which are thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, meat, or beans and served with curtido, a pickled cabbage slaw. Other popular foods are tamales, yuca frita, and various seafood preparations like ceviche. </p>
