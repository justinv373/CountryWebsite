                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Salvadoran history is marked by its Indigenous roots, followed by Spanish conquest and rule, and finally a long period of struggle for independence and stability, defined by cycles of agricultural booms and busts, a powerful land-owning elite, a violent civil war, and persistent challenges with poverty and violence. After achieving independence in 1821, El Salvador experienced decades of political turmoil and civil unrest, which was exacerbated by the economic shift from indigo to coffee, leading to a deeply stratified society that fueled continued conflict. The mid to late 20th century saw a brutal civil war from 1979 to 1992, which finally ended with peace accords but left the nation with deep scars and a legacy of violence that continues to impact its people today. </p>

                <h2>Influence</h2>
                <p>Salvadoran influence in modern years is most notable through its significant diaspora, which has become an integral part of the U.S. social, economic, and cultural landscape. Driven by civil war and economic challenges, a large Salvadoran population settled in U.S. cities, contributing substantially to the American economy through various labor sectors, from construction to healthcare, and sending billions in remittances that are vital to El Salvador's economy. Culturally, Salvadorans have enriched local communities with their traditional cuisine, such as the widely popular pupusa, and have introduced vibrant folk art traditions, music styles like cumbia and chanchona, and active participation in local labor and political advocacy for immigrant rights.  El Salvador also made modern headlines as the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021.</p>
