                <h2>Significant Figures</h2>
                <p>El Salvador has produced several highly influential figures who have made significant impacts globally. Saint Óscar Romero is perhaps the most famous, known universally as a martyr and symbol of human rights for his bold defense of the poor before his assassination in 1980. In the literary sphere, Roque Dalton stands as one of Central America's most celebrated poets and revolutionary writers. More recently, current President Nayib Bukele has captured international attention with his controversial but effective approach to drastically reducing gang violence.</p>

                <h2>Influence</h2>
                <p>Significant Salvadoran people, both in their homeland and the spread of culture, have profoundly influenced society through resilience and cultural contributions, particularly in the arts, politics, and social justice advocacy. Historical figures like indigenous leaders Antu Silan Ulap I and Lempira organized formidable resistance against Spanish colonizers, temporarily halting their permanent settlement. In the modern era, figures such as martyred Archbishop Óscar Romero became a global symbol of human rights advocacy during the civil war, while in the U.S., individuals like poet Claudia Castro Luna and model Christy Turlington have achieved significant mainstream recognition and raised awareness for Salvadoran causes. Their collective influence highlights a lasting spirit of determination and cultural expression in the face of historical adversity.</p>
