                <h2>Cuisine Origin</h2>
                <p>Salvadoran cuisine originates from a rich blend of indigenous Amerindian cultures—including the Pipil, Lenca, and Maya peoples—and later Spanish colonial influences. The pre-Columbian diet heavily featured Mesoamerican staples such as maize (corn), beans, and various local vegetables and herbs, with the iconic pupusa tracing its roots back to the Pipil people over 1,400 years ago. The arrival of the Spanish introduced new ingredients like pork, cheese, and other European culinary techniques, which were then incorporated into existing native dishes, creating the distinct and unique Salvadoran cuisine known today. </p>
